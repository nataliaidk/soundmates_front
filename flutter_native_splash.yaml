# flutter_native_splash Configuration for SoundMates
#
# To use this configuration:
# 1. Add flutter_native_splash to dev_dependencies in pubspec.yaml:
#    flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.5
#
# 2. Run: flutter pub get
#
# 3. Generate splash screens: dart run flutter_native_splash:create
#
# This file configures the native splash screens for Android, iOS, and Web
# to provide a seamless transition from native launch to Flutter app.

flutter_native_splash:
  # Background color for the splash screen
  # Matches LoginScreen: AppColors.surfaceWhite (light mode)
  color: "#FFFFFF"

  # Dark mode: Matches LoginScreen: AppColors.backgroundDark (0xFF1A1A1A)
  color_dark: "#1A1A1A"

  # Logo image (centered) - Shows from frame 0
  image: lib/assets/logo.png

  # Branding image at the bottom (optional)
  # branding: assets/branding.png

  # Android 12+ specific settings
  # On Android 12+, the splash icon is displayed inside a circular mask
  # which clips the logo. We disable the icon entirely and show only
  # the background color, letting Flutter's SplashScreen display the full logo.
  android_12:
    # Background color for Android 12+ (matches Flutter splash background)
    color: "#FFFFFF"
    color_dark: "#1A1A1A"
    # No image - prevents the circular mask clipping issue
    # The Flutter SplashScreen will display the logo properly

  # iOS specific settings
  ios: true

  # Web specific settings
  web: true

  # Preserve the native splash screen until Flutter is ready
  # This prevents a white flash
  android: true
  android_gravity: center
  android_screen_orientation: portrait

  # fullscreen mode
  fullscreen: true
